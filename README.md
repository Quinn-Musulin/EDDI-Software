# EDDI-Software
Software for the Electron Density and Debris Instrument. 

This software is a derivative work based on the software for the Embedded Artists LabTool (available at https://github.com/embeddedartists/labtool), extending its functionality and repurposing it to integrate with EDDI.

To use this software in MCUXpresso, a workspace must be created, into which this project can be imported. The file structure MCUXpresso uses is a project folder containing the workspace folder and the EDDI-Software folder. EDDI-Software was originally called labtool-master, which could be relevant if the project does not build with the name EDDI-Software. The Debug build was always used in development and final software upload, not the release build.
